The missing point 

In the fictional world of “Codekap,” a treasure hunter has received information about a hidden treasure located at a specific point in a three-dimensional space. This point lies on one of the corners of a rectangular prism. The rectangular prism exists in the three-dimensional space, and its faces are parallel to the coordinate axes. Like any other rectangular prism in Codekap, this one also has eight corners. However, the coordinates of one of these corners are missing, and everyone believes that the treasure is located at that missing point. The hunter has the coordinates of seven other corners of the rectangular prism.

Your task is to find the coordinates of the missing corner.
